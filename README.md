## Introduction
A Boomarian Quest game made with Godot. Domino deckbuilder game with interesting mechanics

Turn-based battle where players draw a collection of dominos and make combinations to play.

Dominos have different effects.

Outwit the enemy by playing dominos that prevent the enemy from playing.

Form synergies between different domino effects to land powerful attacks!

## Inspirations
- Dicey Dungeons
- Slay the Spire
- GMTK Game Jam 2022
- Pokemon TCG
- Pokemon Scarlet/Violet

## Why?

I got tired of applying for jobs so I decided to give myself a job which is to make this game.

Hopefully I can put it on my portfolio and have something to talk about with prospective recruiters 

But its mainly to grow a passion of mine which is game development.

## Lessons learnt

- Inheritance and classes (probably to the dismay of my Java lecturer)
- Signals and event-driven programming
    - I don't really like the signal system in Godot but its kind of one of its standout features
    - Event driven programming is really useful for implementing a variety of status effects and buffs though... kinda nifty
- Iterative design and prototyping
- Shaders
- Using AI instead of stack overflow / reddit / Google (it still kind of sucks though)
- Using data-driven programming (dynamic dispatch - using dictionaries to call methoods)
